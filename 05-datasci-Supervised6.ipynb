    "If you have dependent two event, you can calculate the probability of occurence the target event (posterior) using prior probability and conditional probability. In example:\n",
    "- You have many emails and you want to research the spam-probability for a new email\n",
    "- It's very hard to calculate P(A=spam | B=keywords in email) which is posterior probability\n",
    "- According to Bayes theorem, if you already know a prior probability, which is a probability of spam e-mail, you can find the spam probability for a new email\n",
    "- Prior probability can be calculated as #spam emails / #emails, P(A=spam)\n",
    "- The conditional probability can be defined as P(B=keyword | A=spam)\n",
    "- So, you can get P(A=spam | B=keywords in email) = P(B=kw1 | A=spam) * P(B=kw2 | A=spam) * .. *  P(B=kwn | A=spam) * P(A=spam)\n",
