    "- Perceptron is the single unit of neural networks, called as neuron\n",
    "- Every perceptron has an input and output layer, also sum of weighted (parameters) inputs is passed to a step unit function\n",
    "- There is some alternative activation functions as follows:\n",
    "    + Sigmoid function for binary classification\n",
    "    + Tanh function for linear problems\n",
    "    + Softmax can be used for multi-class classification\n",
    "    + Relu\n",
    "- Output layer can be one or more cell across problem types\n",
    "    + For binary class: one output cell (True/False, switch)\n",
    "    + For multi-class: more than one cell (Like hand-written digit problems, 10 class)\n",
    "    + For continous target: house prices\n",
    "- The structure is very similar with regression\n",
