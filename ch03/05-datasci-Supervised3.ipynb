    "There is some metrics that can be used for classification model evaluation:\n",
    "- Confussion Matrix: Precision, Recall, F1-Score\n",
    "- ROC Curve: Area Under Curve, Gini Coefficient\n",
    "- Cumulative Gain-Lift Chart\n",
    "\n",
    "You should split the data to measure the performance on taining, testing and validation, also scoring dataset:\n",
    "- You can apply the fitted model on different time period data to understand performance variation by time\n",
    "- You can split the data in 10-fold to validate the model for each %10 split in 10 iteration\n",
    "- For unbalanced distribution of target variable, can be used bootstrapping \n",
    "- Bootstrap sampling technique helps to balance distribution of target\n",
    "- Also bootstrapping is a solution to reduce sampling variance\n",
    "- Sampling techniques: Random, Stratified, bootstrapping (sample with replacement), top N\n",
    "- Cross validation: Hold-out, K-fold (sample without replacement), LOOCV, Repeated CV\n",
    "    \n",
    "Unbalanced target distribution is a common problem for fraud\n",
    "- Undersampling is another solution to balance the distribution\n",
    "- You can use whole fraud cases with a randomized sub-sample of non-fraud cases\n",
    "- Oversampling means that you can simulate and duplicate fraud cases to balance the distribution\n",
    "- Undersampling is a better solution than oversampling\n",
    " \n",
    "### Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "- Underfitting (Bias): The model can show low performance both training and testing dataset.\n",
    "    + When you face with underfitting problem, you can increase complexity\n",
    "    + Model complexity can be increased by adding new features to models\n",
    "- Overfitting (Variance): The model can perform good on training while performing bad on testing set\n",
    "    + The model learn every details and patterns of training dataset\n",
    "    + The model is not generalized to other data samples\n",
    "    + The solution is to decrease complexity of the model, also increase number of observation size\n",
    "    + You can use regularization term to decrease complexity\n",
