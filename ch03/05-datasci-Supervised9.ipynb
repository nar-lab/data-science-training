    "### k-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "k-NN is a well-known classification task which is based on neighborhood (distance) logic. You need to give a parameter k, the algorithm tries to classify the single point looking for nearest data points' (#k) classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- k-NN is also used for regression tasks\n",
    "- Euclidean distance is generally used for calculation of distance\n",
    "- The k-NN is a \"lazy learning\" system and it can not be preferred for large-scale problems because of memory management\n",
    "    + It can be a useful tool for missing value imputation or some pre-processing tasks instead of modelling\n",
    "- It's not easy to choose optimal k value. Can be decided to it based on trials.\n",
    "    + If you choose a small k-value, i.e. 1, your model will tend to classify the new cases using the most frequent class level (overfitting problem, high-variance)\n",
    "    + If you choose a big k-value, let's say 10, your model will be more robust but can be seen underfitting problem (high bias)\n",
    "    + Optimal k-values depends on your dataset, you need to find optimal k with your trials\n",
    "- There is some other distance metrics can be used like Minkowski, Hamming, Manhattan... \n",
    "- Can be represented as Voronoi diagram"
