    "SVMs can be used for regression and classification, also one-class SVM algorithm can be used in anomaly detection in unsupservised learning concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM can find decision boundaries (classify or fit a line) using hyperplanes with a margin for given data points with/without target\n",
    "- It tries to find maximum margin length to fit optimal model\n",
    "- The data points, which are boundaries for margins, are called as support vectors\n",
    "- SVM can be used for binary and multi-class classification, logistic regression is a common task for a binary classification\n",
    "- SVM model results are not readable\n",
    "- You can tune the models by finding optimal values for hyperparameters like complexity factor, gamma (for gaussian)...\n",
    "- Support vector machines have generally two classifier techniques called as kernels:\n",
    "    + Linear is default kernel\n",
    "    + You can fit a model for non-linear patterns using Gaussian kernel (RBF)\n",
